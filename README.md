# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver using Genetic Programming

# Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a genetic programming algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem in which a salesman is tasked with finding the shortest route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city.

The genetic programming approach uses a population of candidate solutions, evolves them over generations, and selects the fittest individuals to produce increasingly better solutions. The goal is to find an optimal or near-optimal solution to the TSP.

# Features
Genetic Programming Algorithm: Utilizes genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of solutions.
Customizable Parameters: Easily adjust population size, generations, and mutation rates to fine-tune the algorithm's performance.
Visualization: Visualize the evolving solutions and their fitness over generations using built-in plotting functions.
Input Flexibility: Accepts a variety of input formats for specifying cities and their coordinates.
Efficient Implementation: Optimized code for faster convergence and reduced computational overhead.
# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib (for visualization)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tsp-genetic-programming.git
cd tsp-genetic-programming
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib
Usage
Prepare your input data:

Create a text file (e.g., cities.txt) containing the coordinates of cities, one city per line in the format: CityName X Y.
Alternatively, you can use a predefined dataset or generate random city coordinates.
Run the TSP solver:

bash
Copy code
python tsp_genetic.py -f cities.txt
Customize solver parameters as needed (population size, generations, etc.) using command-line arguments.
Visualize the results:

View the evolving solutions and fitness plots to track the algorithm's progress.
